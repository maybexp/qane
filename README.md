# About qane.net (2020â€“2023)

qane.net was a question-and-answer website that allowed anyone to ask and answer questions without requiring registration.

It served as an anonymous, privacy-oriented alternative to Quora, created after I grew tired of being prompted to sign up just to view multiple questions.
